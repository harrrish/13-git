01) Initialize a repository 
    git init

02) Initial Commit 
    git commit -m "initial commit"

03) Stages of files in git 
    Git tracks **file states**, not steps.
        ### 0) **Untracked** 
            > Any new file added will be marked as **untracked**.
                Meaning:
                * File exists in working directory
                * Git does not know about it yet

        ### 1) **Staged** 
            > when we add the file, the file gets staged ready to be committed and tracked.
            > When you run `git add`, the **current snapshot** of the file is placed in the **staging area**.
            Important:
            * Staging is **not the same as tracking**
            * Staging is **temporary selection for next commit**

        ### 2) **Tracked** 
            > Git knows about the file and ready for commit.
            > A **tracked file** is **any file that has been committed at least once** or is already in the index.
            Tracked files can be in these states:
            * Unmodified
            * Modified
            * Staged
            📌 **Tracking is a file property, not a state like staged/modified.**

        ### 3) **Modified** 
            > Two things is the file committed or already is going through the first commit.
            > A file is **modified** when its working-directory version differs from the last committed or staged version.
            > You do **NOT** need to unstage first.
            If a file is staged and then modified again:
            ```bash
            git add file.txt
            ```
            is enough.

            No unstaging required.

    ## Key rules (memorize these)
        1️⃣ **Tracking**
        * Happens after first commit
        * Permanent unless file is removed

        2️⃣ **Staging**
        * Snapshot-based
        * Must re-stage after any further modification

        3️⃣ **Commit**
        * Only includes what is staged

    ## Fixed version of YOUR explanation (clean)
        0) Untracked:
        New file, Git does not know about it.

        1) Staged:
        Current snapshot of the file is added to the staging area.

        2) Tracked:
        File has been committed at least once and is known to Git.

        3) Modified:
        File content differs from last staged or committed version.
        If modified after staging, it must be staged again to include new changes.

    ## One-line summary: **Tracking is about whether Git knows the file; staging is about what version of the file will be committed.**

04) Give the status of all the files. (We check if they are tracked / untracked / staged / unstaged)
    git status 

04) Stage one particular file 
    git add <filename>  

05) Stage all the files   
    git add .

06) Unstage one particular file 
    git restore --staged Commands.txt

07) Unstage all the files  
    git restore --staged .
